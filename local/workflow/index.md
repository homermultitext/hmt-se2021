2. Start Pluto notebooks, and [open validating notebook in the repository](./pluto/) you just cloned.
3. [Edit](./editing/) (a very little bit).
4. [Validate](./validating/).  Fix as necessary.
5. In VS Code, [stage (add), commit and push your changes](./committing/).
6. Repeat 3-5 as often as you like.
7. Quit VS code and [delete the repository](./cleanup/) you cloned.
