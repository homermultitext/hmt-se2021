# Day 5: presenting a scholion


## Goals

Present one *scholion* to the whole group for joint reading and discussion

## What each team will do

Choose one *scholion* your team has looked.  Prepare a markdown slide presentation including:

- the *Iliad* passage your scholion comments on, and a brief summary of the context in the *Iliad*
- the page of the MS your scholion is on.  
- a reference to an illustration that you can put in the chat stream
- your transcription
- questions, problems, highlights
