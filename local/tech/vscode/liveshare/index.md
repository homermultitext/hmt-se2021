# Live Share extension



The "Live Share" extension allows us to edit colaborate in an editing session over the internet.  It might feel a little like a shared Google Doc, but instead of sharing one document, Live Share lets us share the entire editing session, so team members can work together on all the documents we create in editing a manuscript.

- Install the "Live Share" extension
