Congratulations on your selection for participation in this year's Homer Multitext project "Summer Experience!"  We will meet for ten one-hour sessions  on Monday through Friday, beginning on Monday, June 28, and ending Friday, July 9, at 12:00 noon Eastern time (which should be 9:00 a.m. on the west coast, and 6:00 pm in the Netherlands).

I will send a follow-up email later in May with more details about the program. At that time, I will ask you to complete a brief Google form with some background information, as well as the administrative forms necessary to send you your honorarium for taking part in this year's program.

I look forward to meeting all of you, even if it is only by Zoom for now.

With best wishes,

Neel Smith
